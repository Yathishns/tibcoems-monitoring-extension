TibcoEMSMonitor
===============

## Introduction

An AppDynamics Machine Agent add-on to report metrics from a [Tibco EMS
Server][] and its queues.

Tibco EMS is messaging middleware that provides persistent queues as well as
a publish/subscribe mechanism. It can be used as a JMS provider, or it can be
used directly via native API's.

This extension requires the Java Machine Agent.


## Prerequisites

Before starting this monitor, make sure your EMS server is configured to report
statistics. You can do this by editing the file `tibemsd.conf` in your
`TIBCO_HOME`, or by using the `tibemsadmin` command line utility.


#### Configuring statistics by editing tibemsd.conf

1. Add the following line to `tibemsd.conf`:

        statistics = enabled

1. Restart Tibco EMS.


#### Configuring statistics using the command line

Use the `tibemsadmin` utility to change the server configuration.

        root# tibemsadmin -server localhost:7222

        Connected to: tcp://localhost:7222
        Type 'help' for commands help, 'exit' to exit:
        tcp://localhost:7222> set server statistics=enabled
        Server parameters have been changed
        tcp://localhost:7222> quit
        bye


## Installation

1. Download TibcoEMSMonitor.zip from the Community.
2. Copy TibcoEMSMonitor.zip into the directory where you installed the
   machine agent, under `$AGENT_HOME/monitors`.
3. Unzip the file. This will create a new directory called `TibcoEMSMonitor`.
4. In `$AGENT_HOME/monitors/TibcoEMSMonitor`, edit the file `monitor.xml` and
   configure the extension for your Tibco EMS installation.
5. Restart the machine agent.


## Configuration

Configuration for this monitor is in the `monitor.xml` file in the monitor
directory. All of the configurable options are in the `<task-arguments>`
section.

hostname
: Name or IP address of the Tibco EMS server. Required.

port
: TCP port number where the Tibco server is listening. The default value is
  7222. Required.

userid
: Administrative user ID for the Tibco admin interface. The default value is
  "admin". Required.

password
: Password for the administrative user ID. The default value is an empty
  password. Required.

tier
: Name of the tier in AppDynamics for which the monitor should register its
  metrics. If not specified, the metrics will be registered on all tiers.
  Optional.

emsservername
: An additional folder to create under the "Custom Metrics" folder.
  Optional.

showTempQueues
: If set to true, the monitor will report metrics on temporary queues (defined
  as any queue whose name starts with `$TMP$.`). **NOTE:** Enabling this option
  can potentially cause the agent to overflow its metric limit.

showSysQueues
: If set to true, the monitor will report metrics on system queues (defined as
  any queue whose name starts with `$sys.`).

## Caution

This monitor can potentially register hundred of new metrics, depending on how
many queues are in EMS. By default, the Machine Agent will only report 200
metrics to the controller, so you may need to increase that limit when
installing this monitor. To increase the metric limit, you must add a parameter
when starting the Machine Agent, like this:

    java -Dappdynamics.agent.maxMetrics=1000 -jar machineagent.jar

Please note that the maximum value you can provide is 5000.
